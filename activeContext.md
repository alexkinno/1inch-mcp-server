# Active Context - 1inch MCP Server

## Current Focus: FastMCP v2 Migration Complete
**Mode**: IMPLEMENT → Migration Success
**Session Goal**: Successfully migrated from MCP v1 to FastMCP v2

## Key Findings from VAN Analysis:
1. **Strong Foundation**: FastMCP server framework is well-implemented
2. **Critical Gap**: No actual 1inch API integration - only static protocol info
3. **Architecture Ready**: Good structure for extending with real tools
4. **Security Concern**: DeFi operations require careful security design
5. **Complexity Assessment**: Level 2-3 (requires PLAN mode)

## FastMCP v2 Migration Results:
1. ✅ Successfully upgraded from `mcp>=1.12.2` to `fastmcp>=2.0.0` 
2. ✅ Refactored server.py to use FastMCP v2 API
3. ✅ Updated tool handlers to modern decorator pattern
4. ✅ Both stdio and HTTP transports working perfectly
5. ✅ Documentation updated with FastMCP v2 references

## Immediate Next Steps:
1. Ready to proceed with 1inch API integration planning
2. Foundation now stable on FastMCP v2 (2.10.6)
3. Can now focus on core business value implementation

## Current Implementation Status:
- ✅ FastMCP server (HTTP + stdio transport)
- ✅ Basic project structure and containerization
- ✅ Logging infrastructure
- ❌ **BLOCKING**: Missing actual 1inch API integration
- ❌ **BLOCKING**: Missing comprehensive tool suite

## Priority Requirements:
1. **API Client**: Complete 1inch API integration
2. **Tool Suite**: Swap, quote, limit order, balance tools
3. **Security**: Safe wallet interaction patterns
4. **Error Handling**: Robust DeFi operation error management
5. **Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage

## Context Handoff to PLAN Mode:
- Project assessment complete via VAN
- Clear complexity level identified (Level 2-3)
- Critical gaps identified and documented
- Foundation architecture validated
- Ready for detailed planning phase
